# Weird Nonfiction

[Weird Nonfiction](https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/weird-nonfiction/) is a genre that blends elements of fiction and nonfiction in a way that disrupts conventional expectations and confuses the audience. It is defined as creative work that presents itself as journalism or factual narrative but intentionally introduces fictional components to provoke uncertainty, disturb, or play with the readerâ€™s perception of reality.
